# Word generator

## Purpose

This tool builds random words that are based on an abstract word structure.

The user specifies a syllable structure (optional letters in brackets), and lists of letters to fit in each slot.

eg.
V = [a, e, i, o, u]
C = [p, t, k, s, h, m, n, l]
syllable structure: (C)V(C)(V)

...generates syllables eg.:
at
man
tol

Words will then be created using 1+ syllables.
